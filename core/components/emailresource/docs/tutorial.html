<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The EmailResource plugin for MODX Revolution will format and email any resource on your site. It will convert your CSS code to inline styles in the email so that the email will have HTML formatting. The CSS code can be taken from multiple CSS files, resources, or chunks. As of EmailResource version 1.1.2, you can send the email to all members of selected User Groups and you can use tags to send the email to selected members of each User Group.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p>An alternative to EmailResource is the <a href="[[~268]]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Notify extra</a>. Rather than sending a whole resource to users, Notify just sends an email with a link to the resource, which takes a lot of pressure off your server and the internet.</p>

    <p>Notify works with the <a href="[[~227]]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Subscribe extra</a> to give users more opportunity to manage their preferences about which emails to receive. Notify also (optionally) shortens URLs, and can use Mailgun, which gives you faster sending and better deliverability.</p>
</div>


<h3>How EmailResource Works</h3>
    
<p>The package works in a kind of an odd way. It emails the resource when you preview it from the MODX manager. To make that happen, you need to set values for some of the template variables attached to the resource (listed below). You may also want to set the properties of the plugin to the values you want in your email header.</p>

<p>This extra would not exist without the generous support provided by <a href="http://www.workdaymedia.com.au">WorkDay Media</a>.</p>

<h3>Installing EmailResource for MODX Revolution</h3>

<p>Go to Extras | Installer on the MODX Top menu to open Package Manager. Click on the "Download Extras" button. That will take you to the Revolution Repository. Put EmailResource in the search box and press Enter. Click on the "Download" button, and when the download has finished," click on the "Return to Package Manager" button. That should bring you back to your Package Management grid. Click on the "Install" button next to EmailResource in the grid. The EmailResource plugin should now be installed.</p>
        
<h3>Usage</h3>
        
<p>The template variables used to control EmailResource will appear on the EmailResource section of the Template Variables tab when you edit a resource. If you don't see them, it means that you haven't attached the EmailResource TVs to the template used by the resource.        

<p>If the &quot;Preview Email&quot; TV is set to &quot;Yes&quot;, you will see the email that will be sent instead of the regular resource when you preview it.</p>

<p>If the &quot;Send Test Email&quot; TV is set to &quot;Yes&quot;, the email version of the resource will be sent to the address specified in the &quot;Email Address For Test&quot; TV.</p>
        
<p>If the &quot;Bulk Email on Preview&quot; TV is set to &quot;Yes&quot;, the resource will be emailed to all Users in the User Group or Groups specified in the &quot;Groups&quot; TV.</p>

<p>If the &quot;Tags&quot; TV contains a comma-separated list of tags, the resource will be only be emailed to Users in the User Group or Groups specified in the &quot;Groups&quot; TV who have any of the listed tags in the 'comment' field of their User Profile.</p>
        
        
<p>The TV values related to sending email are not set by default, because if they were, every time you previewed a resource, you'd be getting a copy of it in your email. You could also accidentally send multiple copies of the same email to Users. To prevent this, the &quot;Send Test Email&quot; and &quot;Bulk Email on Preview&quot; TVs are turned off (set to &quot;No&quot;) for a resource as soon as it is emailed, so you have to turn them on and save the resource each time you want to actually send the email. Don't forget to save the resource before viewing it if you want to email.</p>


<p>To review, the plugin is controlled by a set of Template Variables that will appear on the Template Variable tab when editing any resource using a template to which the TVs are attached. Just edit the resource, set the TVs, save the resource, and preview it. All generic TVs to be used across various pages are set to @INHERIT, so if you set them in a parent container, all children will inherit the parent's values for the TVs.</p>
        
<p>Because the plugin is attached to the OnWebPagePrerender event and only acts when a page is previewed from the Manager, it has no effect for visitors to the front end of the web site. To users in the front end, the resource will appear as it would without the plugin installed. For increased security, the plugin will not execute at all unless you are logged in to the Manager.</p>

<p><b>Important!</b> In order for EmailResource to operate on the current version of the TVs, you must *Save* the resource before previewing it. Always save the resource before any preview that will send email.</p>        

<h3>Sending Bulk Email to Subscribers </h3>        

<p>As of EmailResource version 1.1.2, you can email a resource to all members of specified User Groups. Put a comma-separated list of User Groups in the Groups TV and set &quot;Bulk Email on Preview&quot; to &quot;Yes&quot;. If you have tags set up (see below), you can also fill in the Tags box. When you preview the resource by clicking on the &quot;View&quot; button at the upper right, the emails will be sent. Be sure to *save* the resource before previewing or no emails will be sent.</p>
  
<p>When you send bulk emails, EmailResource will create a log file for each send in the core/components/emailresource/logs directory. The filename will be based on the resource's alias and the date of the send.</p>
        

<h3>Tag-based Sending</h3>

<p>You can place a comma-separated list of tags in the 'comment' field of the User Profile for each User. If there are tags present in that field and you specify tags in the Tags TV, only Users with corresponding tags will receive the email. You must still specify the User Groups to send to in the &quot;Groups&quot; TV.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bobsguides.com/subscribe-tutorial.html">Subscribe</a> package will allow Users to register on the site and select tags you define. The tags will be automatically placed in the 'comment' field of the User's Profile (or in an extended field of the User Profile) for use by EmailResource. As of <a href="https://bobsguides.com/subscribe-tutorial.html">Subscribe</a> Version 1.2.0, users can manage their tags on a &quot;Manage Preferences&quot; page.</p>

<p>Using Subscribe is strongly recommended, but if you choose not to install it, you can still put the users' preferences (tags) in an extended field of the User Profile (say, because you need the <fixedpre>comment</fixedpre> field for something else). Just create two new System Settings:</p>

<pre><fixedpre>
    sbs_use_comment_field
    sbs_extended_field
</fixedpre></pre>

<p>Set the first one to <fixedpre>No</fixedpre> and the second one to the name of the extended field you would like to use (the default is <fixedpre>interests</fixedpre>). If Subscribe is not installed, you will need to create the extended field for each user and list the tags in it manually. Be careful that they are spelled correctly.</p>

<h3>User Group Management</h3>

<p>You can create and assign the User Groups manually, but as with tags, the <a href="https://bobsguides.com/subscribe-tutorial.html">Subscribe</a> extra will assign the User Groups and roles automatically and will (optionally) let users manage their own User Group memberships. See the
<a href="https://bobsguides.com/subscribe-tutorial.html">Subscribe</a> documentation for more information on how to use this feature.</p>

<h3>Unsubscribe Link</h3>
<p><b>Important: </b> In order to use this feature, you must have <a href="https://bobsguides.com/subscribe-tutorial.html">Subscribe</a> Version 1.2.0 or later installed.</p>

<p>If Subscribe is installed, EmailResource will include an unsubscribe link at the bottom of every email. This is required for all bulk email by the USA CAN-spam act, so it is *very* strongly recommended. If Subscribe Version 1.2.0 or later is installed, this will be done automatically. The link is injected just above the closing <fixedpre>body</fixedpre> tag, or appended to the end of the message if there is no <fixedpre>body</fixedpre> tag.</p>

<p>The unsubscribe message comes from the Tpl chunk named in the <fixedpre>unsubscribe_tpl</fixedpre> property. The default chunk is called <fixedpre>unsubscribeTpl</fixedpre>, but if you need to modify it, you should duplicate it (call it <fixedpre>myunsubscribeTpl</fixedpre> and set that name in the property so it won't be overwritten if you upgrade or reinstall EmailResource. Be sure to have the <fixedpre>[[+unsubscribeUrl]]></fixedpre> tag in your chunk inside an href tag. EmailResource will replace the tag with a secure URL that is different for each user.</p>

<h3>CSS files</h3>
<p>In order for EmailResources to find your CSS files, they either have to be placed in chunks or resources, or all exist in the same directory (defined in the CssBasePath TV). If your CSS files specify background images, be sure that the url specified in the CSS file contains a full, absolute URL to each image.</p>

<h3>EmailResource Plugin Properties</h3>

<p>These properties set the various values for the email header. The &quot;To&quot; address for the test email is set in the Email Address For Test template variable listed above. The other values are set on the properties tab of the plugin itself.</p>

<p>The properties are optional and many of the default values may work for you. For those that don't, you should create a property set called &quot;MyEmailResourcePropertySet&quot; on the properties tab of the plugin so that your values are not overwritten when you upgrade the EmailResource package. After creating the property set, make sure you are editing it rather than the default properties (it's name will show in the drop-down box at the upper-left of the grid). Just double-click on the values you want to change and enter the new value. Don't forget to save the property set, using the &quot;Save Property Set&quot; button when you're done.</p>

<p>Whenever you want to edit the properties, make sure that the name is showing there so that you are not changing the default properties. Any values of the default properties will be overwritten when you upgrade the EmailResource package. </p>

<p>Be sure to attach your property set to the plugin by clicking on the &quot;System Events&quot; tab. Scroll down to the end where the OnWebPagePrerender event is checked. Double-click on the Property Set column and select &quot;MyEmailResourcePropertySet.&quot; Then, save the plugin. It will then use your property set for the email setting values.</p>

        <td>(optional but highly recommended) Comma-separated list of Template IDs. List all templates used by resources that might be emailed. This will speed up the site by preventing the plugin from running for pages that will not be emailed. Use no spaces in the list. Remember to update this value if you create a new template for resources that will be emailed.</td>

<h3>A Final Note</h3>
        
<p>
    You might not want to send a complete resource to Users. You might want, for example, want to send a short message, a note about an updated page, or a link to a new page or section. Remember that EmailResource can send *any* resource to your Users. You can easily create a new resource with a minimal or empty template, write a short note in the Resource Content field, and send it off to the Users. That note can be as short or ad long as you want and can contain links. Be sure to attach all the EmailResource TVs to any template used and to update the <fixedpre>template_list</fixedpre> property of the EmailResource plugin (if you're using it). As always, remember to save the resource before viewing it.
