EmailResource is a plugin that sends an email version of any resource. The plugin is connected to the OnWebPagePrerender System Event and acts when the resource if previewed in the MODX Manager.

CSS is converted to inline CSS and all links are converted to full URLs.

Adds an unsubscribe link with every email (requires Subscribe extra)

This extra would not exist without the generous support provided by [WorkDay Media](http://www.workdaymedia.com.au)

EmailResource makes use of the excellent CSSToInlineStyles class created by Tijs Verkoyen
